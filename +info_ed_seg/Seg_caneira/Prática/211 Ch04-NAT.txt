NAT
-----------------
- Introdution
This document explain how you can configure network address translation (NAT) in a Cisco router.
In this scenario, we are using the firewall environment on the GNS3.
We aim to configure in such a way that the PC1, with IP 192.168.1.1 will reach the 5.5.5.5 with the IP address 194.65.52.130.

- Prepare the correct interfaces you want to do NAT
For this step, we need to understand that we must configure the router in such a way that it will understand from which interface it is supposed to arrive the private (RFC1918) traffic and where it should apply the NAT.
So, in our case, we know that interface F0/0, on the R1, is the nearest interface to the PC1. And we want to apply NAT when traffic is going to the WAN (R-ISP).
To do this, we apply the following commands:
	configure terminal
        int f0/0
            ip nat inside
        int s1/0
            ip nat outside

- Configure an ACL to define which networks should apply the NAT
We now must define which networks will be subject to NAT operation.
In our example, we are considering the RFC1918 network 192.168.1.0/24.
So, the following is true:
        access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

With this command we are stating that if the IP address is on 192.168.1.0/24 network range when it reaches the "ip nat inside" interface, then it will be subject to NAT if it is going to an "ip nat outside" interface.

- Define the pool of NAT
Now, we must define what public IPs will be used to NAT the private IPs.
That means that router will use these IPs in order to map existing communications.
To apply this, we will use the following command
        ip nat pool local_users 194.65.52.130 194.65.52.131 prefix 25

In this example, all RFC1918 IPs defined in ACL 1 will be translated to IP address 194.65.52.130 or 194.65.52.131, depending on the amount of simultaneous communications running at each moment.
It is advised to give some amount of IPs depending on the load you are expecting in the network.
Our pool will have the name "local_users". This variable can be whatever we need.

- Map the ACL to the NAT pool
In the final stage we must associate the ACL to the correct pool, in our case, the "local_user" pool.
For this we use the following command
        ip mat inside source list 1 pool local_users

And that's it! :)
